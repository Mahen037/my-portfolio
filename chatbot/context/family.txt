My father: He was unable to complete high school due to financial constraints. Now in his 60s, he works in a stainless steel factory that manufactures utensils.

My mother: She never had the opportunity to attend school and manages the household.

I have four brothers and no sisters, making us five brothers in total.

Eldest brother: He completed only elementary school and began working with my father in the same factory.

Second brother: He finished high school and secured a job in the Indian Air Force.

Third brother: He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and is currently preparing for government job examinations in India.

As for myself, Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My education has been made possible through support from the Sitare Foundation, founded by Dr. Amit Singhal, which sponsored my middle and high school education, and the Swami Vivekananda Scholarship, which is funding my university studies.
